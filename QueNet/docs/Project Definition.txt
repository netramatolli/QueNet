Database Design

===============================================================================

Introduction: The project will provide a platform to develop medical 
  questionaires that facilitate data collection, analysis and reporting.  
  
  1) The database will support multiple projects. All projects are independent 
     studies but may have some common aspects, which need to be handled similarly
     in all projects.  Therefore, there is a need to identify work-breakdown 
     structure and mark each task/work as belonging to specific project or 
     the common framework.  
  
  2) Each Project will have several forms arranged in a hierarchy.  The Common 
     project will provide templates for forms, questions and evaluation parameters.
     Each project will have its own copy of template forms, where necessary.
  
  3) Each Form will have several questions.  The forms within a project are 
     ordered as a hierarchy (decision-tree), which will define how respondents
     will see the questions.   The order is generally fixed but directed by the
     answers provided by the respondent.  Respondents do not see any hierarchy 
     but a simple one directional flow.
     
  4) A question can be any one of several supported types of questions. A minimal
     format of questions would be yes-no, true-false, one-of-several, multi-choice,
     matching options,  etc.  The answer provided by the respondent will lead 
     to end of session, or one or more questions, in the same form or other form
     but within the same project.  Forms or templates from common project(s) are
     simply duplicated at the time of creation.  This allows common project to
     evolve independent of the evolution of other projects.
     
  5) Evaluation methods are part of the question itself. Towards this goal,
     the possible answers, correct options, values or key words are stored as an 
     essential part of the question itself.
     
  6) The database shall support a role based user identification.  Each project
     shall have one administrator, who can add other users or respondents. 
     Other users can examine
